## Pre-defined method delegation tests

[DelegateTests](../apidocs/com/github/robtimus/junit/support/test/DelegateTests.html) makes it relatively easy to test that objects delegate to objects of the same type.

### Examples

See [here](https://github.com/robtimus/junit-support/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/robtimus/junit/support/examples/delegation) for examples on using the interfaces in this library to create test classes.
